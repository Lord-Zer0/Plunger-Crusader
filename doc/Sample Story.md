# Plunger Crusader -- Sample Story

## Game Introduction

Long ago, the Unblockers protected the lands of Rul from the servants of the Primordial Chaos.

The chaos sought to destroy all of creation and reshape it into a twisted manifestation of their own will. The Unblockers, a holy order of plunger crusaders, defeated the minions of chaos wherever they emerged.

The two groups made up the perfect power dynamic. Together, as mortal enemies, they marked the balance between light and dark, order and chaos.

Or at least, that's the way it used to be.

Nowadays? the Chaos has grown quiet. The people of <<>> have grown complacent. And worst of all, the Unblockers have nearly gone broke.

In dire need of work, the few Unblockers left have sought drastic solutions to a common tale of unemployment.

Rather than exploring other lines of work, the remaining plunger crusaders have determined to find their most hated enemy, and check up on them to make sure they're okay.

## Sample Level: Path to Rul

### Zone: Rul Outskirts

We join our so-called heroes upon their approach to the Gates of Ruin, midway through the adventure to find the source of the primordial chaos. "Abandon all hope ye who enter here", but the last few Unblocker knights cannot afford to turn back now. Literally. Go out and do your thing. Go clear a path and find some cash while you're at it.
